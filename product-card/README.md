## AI prompts used

Briefly: AI assistance was used throughout the project development:

1. **Initial Component Creation**: Create a ProductCard component for an e-commerce application. Include product image, title, description, price, rating, and add to cart button. Make it responsive with hover effects. Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

2. **Rating Component**: Create a RatingStars component that supports decimal ratings (e.g., 4.5 stars), multiple size options, and shows review count.

3. **Demo Page**: Create a demo page with multiple products showcasing the ProductCard component in a responsive grid layout.

4. **Playwright Tests**: Add comprehensive Playwright end-to-end tests covering authentication, product operations, navigation, accessibility, and responsive design.

5. **Test Adjustments**: Adjust test selectors and fix test failures while keeping component behavior unchanged.

6. **Documentation**: Document run instructions, test commands, and project structure.
